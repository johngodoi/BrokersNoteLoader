# BrokersNoteLoader
This application aims to convert some broker's note into a formatted text that can be easily imported to a spreadsheet. 

Currently we are focusing on [Clear](https://www.clear.com.br/) brokeage note and may add other in the future.

This code is initially based on [Alvin Alexander's Scala PDF to Text code](https://alvinalexander.com/scala/convert-pdf-to-plain-text-application-scala-shell-script/).
